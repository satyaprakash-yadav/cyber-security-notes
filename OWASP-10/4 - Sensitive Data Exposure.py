#                           Sensitive Data Exposure

# When a webapp accidentally divulges sensitive data, we refer to it as "Sensitive Data Exposure".
# This is often data directly linked to customers (e.g. names, dates-of-birth, financial information,
# etc), but could also be more technical information, such as usernames and passwords. At more complex
# levels this often involves techniques such as a "Man in The Middle Attack"
