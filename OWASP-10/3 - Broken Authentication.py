#                           Broken Authentication


# Brute force attacks: If a web application uses usernames and passwords


# weak credentials: web applications should set strong password policies.


# Weak Session Cookies: Session cookies are how the server keeps track of users.




# mitigation for broken authentication mechanisms

# To avoid password guessing attacks, ensure the application enforces a strong password policy.

# To avoid brute force attacks, ensure that the application enforces an automatic lockout after a certain number of attempts

# Implement Multi Factor Authentication
